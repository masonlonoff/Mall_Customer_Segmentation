## Description
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

## Dataset Information
**Customer ID** - Unique ID assigned to the customer\
**Gender** - Gender of the Customer\
**Age** - Age of the Customer\
**Annual Income (k$)** - Annual Income of the customer\
**Spending Score (1-100)** - Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature\

## Objectives
1) Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset
2) Examine each column to understand its underlying characteristics
3) Through experimentation, find out which model produces the best clusters for further analysis
4) Visualize and understand the differences between each segment in order for a Marketing Team to create distinct strategies for

## Strategic Plan of Action
1) Entire dataset specific EDA
2) Column specific EDA
3) Experiment with K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Model, Birch, and MeanShift clustering model with PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP dimension reduction techniques
4) Visualize the characteristics of each segment
5) Summarize each segment
