Data visual file will be complementary to my actual segmentation models. I'll frame it as info that marketing could use as supporting or complementary info

NEEDS dimension reductionality
kmeans, hierarchal, dbscan, gmm, density clustering, 

silhouette and calinkski scores

add a column for each model's segment output, write that to a new csv and use it for visuals
